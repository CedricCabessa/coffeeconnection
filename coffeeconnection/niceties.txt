Hello {} and {}, would you like a coffee?

Lucky you! {} and {} get to know each other

Sorry {}, but {} want to see you at the bar

The fate has decided to match {} and {} for a drink

{}, {}: coffee, now

Let's see if {} and {} are beverage compatible

{} {}, I'm sure you can use a break

Hey {}, whatever your problem is, {} has the solution

{} {} :coffee:

{} + {} = coffee

{} and {}, what else?

{}, allow me to introduce {}.

{} and {}, you too really should get to know each other.

Hey {}, {} secretly wants to meet you!

{} and {}, let's have a cup of deep black joe!

{} said to {}: "This is excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee."

"What time is it?", said {}. "It's coffee time.", answered {}.
