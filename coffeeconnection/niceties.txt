Hello {} and {}, would you like a coffee?

Lucky you! {} and {} get to know each other

Hey {}, {} wants to see you at the bar

The fate has decided to match {} and {} for a drink

{}, {}: coffee, now

Let's see if {} and {} are beverage compatible

{} {}, I'm sure you can use a break

Hey {}, whatever your problem is, {} has the solution

{} {} :coffee:

{} + {} = coffee

{} and {}, what else?

{}, allow me to introduce {}.

{} and {}, you too really should get to know each other.

Hey {}, {} secretly wants to meet you!

{} and {}, let's have a cup of deep black joe!

{} said to {}: "This is excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee."

"What time is it?", said {}. "It's coffee time.", answered {}.

Hey {} it's beertime in Moscow, let's grab a coffee with {}

{} would you rather have a coffee with {} or not drink coffee for 1 full week?

{} would you rather lead a boring life from here on forward or have a coffee with {} ?

{} and {} have a coffee, and hereâ€™s a game to break to ice: share 3 facts about yourself with the other person, one of which has to be a lie. The other person has to guess what is truth and what is lie.

{} and {}, have a break, have a coffee!

{}, have you met {} ?
